- Converts any notification-only system into interactive workflows
- Auto-executes low-risk recommendations
- Interactive prompts for manual review items
- Comprehensive session reporting
- Risk assessment and categorization

**Impact**: Eliminates the #1 UX frustration - systems that show problems but don't let you fix them

#### 2. Optimization Engine (`scripts/optimization-engine.ts`)
**Purpose**: AI-powered continuous optimization system

**Features**:
- Automatic detection of optimization opportunities
- ROI-based prioritization (Return on Investment scoring)
- Performance metrics collection and trending
- Interactive implementation with user control
- Historical tracking and improvement measurement

**Current Opportunities Detected**:
1. **Parallel Task Execution** (ROI: 85) - 50% speedup for maintenance
2. **Smart Caching System** (ROI: 75) - 70% faster repeat operations
3. **Automation Level Increase** (ROI: 70) - More auto-fixable patterns

#### 3. Enhanced Command System
**New Commands Added**:
- `npm run workflow:optimize` - Interactive workflow improvements
- `npm run optimize` - Full optimization analysis and implementation
- `npm run optimize:analyze` - Analysis-only mode
- `npm run optimize:trends` - Historical optimization trends

#### 4. Governance System Optimization
**Integration Enforcement Improvements**:
- More reasonable component categorization logic
- Better error messages with helpful suggestions
- Support for different component types (internal, dev, utility, user-facing)
- Auto-integration capabilities
