# Changelog

## 2025-10-08 - Adaptive Ecosystem Evolution (v3): "Living Organism → Self-Learning Ecosystem"

- **docs**: **NEW RFC - Adaptive Ecosystem Development Plan** (Phase 2.2-2.4)
  - **3 Evolution Axes introduced**:
    1. **Meta-Governance Engine** (Phase 2.2) - Self-optimizing policies, -70% maintenance time
    2. **Synthetic Ecosystem Simulator** (Phase 2.3) - Zero-risk expansion, 95% pre-prod conflict detection
    3. **Cross-Tenant Intelligence Exchange** (Phase 2.4) - Collective learning, +30-50% improvement acceleration
  - **4 Self-* Capabilities**: Self-Correcting, Self-Learning, Self-Protecting, Self-Adaptive
  - **Detailed specifications**: 550+ lines comprehensive implementation guide
  - **Timeline**: 11-13 weeks (Phase 2.2: 3w, Phase 2.3: 4w, Phase 2.4: 4-6w)

- **docs**: Integrated Roadmap v2 enhancement
  - Phase 2.2-2.4 reference section added
  - Future roadmap restructured with v3 evolution axes

- **docs**: SESSION_STATE.md v3 update
  - Evolution axes + self-capabilities documented
  - Phase 2.2-2.4 component tracking added
  - Development philosophy: "Don't add features, embed intelligence"

- **strategy**: Strategic shift from feature-driven to intelligence-driven development
  - Operational Intelligence as core development philosophy
  - Structural moat formation through meta-governance + simulation + federated learning
  - Competitive advantage: BigTech cannot easily replicate collective learning + self-optimizing governance
