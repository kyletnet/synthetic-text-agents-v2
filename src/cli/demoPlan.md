# Demo Plan: Meta-Adaptive Expert Orchestration System

## Scenario Overview

**Task**: Generate 10 high-quality customer service Q&A pairs for a SaaS company dealing with billing inquiries and technical support issues.

**Quality Target**: 8.5/10
**Domain**: customer_service
**Specialization**: billing_and_technical_support
**Expected Complexity**: 6/10 (moderate complexity due to technical and financial aspects)

## Demo Flow

### Phase 1: System Initialization

1. **Registry Setup**: Register all 8 agents with the system
2. **Logger Initialization**: Start trace logging for complete transparency
3. **Message Bus**: Initialize inter-agent communication system

### Phase 2: Request Processing

1. **Meta-Controller Analysis**:

   - Analyze complexity (expect ~6/10)
   - Select agent combination (expect 7 agents: exclude cognitive-scientist for moderate complexity)
   - Determine collaboration strategy (expect: hybrid approach)

2. **Expert Council Consultation**:
   - **Psychology Specialist**: Analyze customer emotional states (frustrated, seeking resolution)
   - **Linguistics Engineer**: Optimize for Claude Sonnet 4 LLM
   - **Domain Consultant**: Provide customer service expertise and billing/technical knowledge

### Phase 3: Content Creation Pipeline

1. **Prompt Architect**: Integrate expert recommendations into optimized prompt
2. **QA Generator**: Generate 10 Q&A pairs using the optimized prompt
3. **Quality Auditor**: Verify quality on all 4 levels (structural, expertise, practicality, innovation)

### Phase 4: Results and Analysis

1. **Performance Guardian**: Monitor collaboration efficiency and identify bottlenecks
2. **Trace Analysis**: Review decision-making process through logs
3. **Quality Metrics**: Validate achievement of 8.5/10 quality target

## Expected Outputs

### Sample Q&A Pairs

**Example 1 (Billing)**:

- Q: How should a customer service representative handle a billing dispute when the customer claims they were charged for services they cancelled 3 months ago?
- A: First, acknowledge the customer's frustration and apologize for the inconvenience. Access their account history to verify the cancellation date and review all charges since then. If the cancellation was properly processed but charges continued due to a system error, immediately issue a refund for the erroneous charges and ensure the cancellation is fully effective. If there's confusion about cancellation terms (like notice periods), explain the policy clearly while showing empathy. Document the resolution, provide a ticket number for tracking, and follow up within 48 hours to confirm satisfaction.

**Example 2 (Technical Support)**:

- Q: What's the best approach for troubleshooting when a customer reports that their software integration suddenly stopped working after months of functioning correctly?
- A: Begin with a systematic diagnostic approach: 1) Confirm the specific error symptoms and when they first occurred, 2) Check for any recent changes on their end (updates, configuration changes, network changes), 3) Verify API connectivity and authentication status, 4) Review server logs for error patterns, 5) Test the integration endpoints independently. If the issue appears to be on your platform's side, escalate to the technical team immediately while keeping the customer informed of progress. Provide a temporary workaround if available, and establish a clear timeline for resolution with regular updates.

### Performance Metrics

- **Generation Time**: ~3-5 minutes for 10 Q&A pairs
- **Quality Scores**: All pairs should achieve 8.0+ with average 8.5+
- **Agent Collaboration**: Efficient handoffs with minimal conflicts
- **Memory Usage**: Under 50MB for entire process
- **Token Usage**: Estimated 2,000-3,000 tokens total

### Trace Log Sample

```json
{
  "id": "abc123",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "level": "info",
  "agentId": "meta-controller",
  "action": "complexity_analysis_completed",
  "data": {
    "complexityScore": 6,
    "agentSelection": "standard",
    "reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to dual domain requirements (billing + technical)"
  }
}
```
